# Auto Mode Guide

## Overview
The Mines game now includes an advanced "Auto Mode" that allows players to set up predictions before automatic gameplay.

## How to Use Auto Mode

### 1. Switch to Auto Mode
- Click the "Auto" tab at the top of the game

### 2. Select Winning Tiles
- In Auto mode, click on tiles in the grid to mark them as "winning positions"
- Selected tiles will turn **orange**
- These are the positions where you predict gems will appear

### 3. Configure Number of Plays
- Use the "-" and "+" buttons to set how many automatic rounds you want to play
- Default is 1 play

### 4. Start Auto Play
- Once you've selected tiles, the "Start Auto" button will become enabled
- Click "Start Auto" to begin the automatic game
- Your bet will be deducted immediately

### 5. Watch the Game
- All tiles will automatically reveal
- The game will check if all gems fall within your selected tiles:
  - **Win** 🎉: All gems are in your selected orange tiles
  - **Loss** ❌: At least one gem is outside your selected tiles
- A result badge will display showing the outcome

### 6. Round Loop
- After 1 second, the next round starts automatically
- This repeats for the number of plays you configured
- Once all rounds complete, auto play stops

### 7. Manual Control
- Click "Stop Auto" button to stop the auto play loop at any time

## Win Condition
- **You Win** when: Every gem (non-mine cell) appears within your selected tiles
- **You Lose** when: At least one gem appears outside your selected tiles

## Tips
- Select a pattern of tiles that covers areas you think gems will appear
- More tiles selected = Higher chance of winning but less selective
- Fewer tiles selected = Only tiles you're confident about (riskier)
- Run multiple plays (3-5) to increase chances of at least one win
